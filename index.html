          <p>
            The concept was inspired by the original architecture of the House
            itself: the geometric elements of the main facade, which attract
            attention, the bright and spacious rooms with five-meter ceilings,
            immediately refer to the aesthetics of American classic art deco.

            protruding details and a large number of windows. This is a
            well-defined composition of polished granite with rustic elements,
            large-format porcelain stoneware and custom-made decorative
            elements.

          <p>

            a priority, where visible luxury is combined with comfort, any
            technical devices and devices fit perfectly into it.

            A journey into the world of impeccable taste begins with the lobby:
            the walls are decorated with natural stone coating, mirrored
            decorative panels, made according to the author's design. The House
            has its own fitness area, on the ground floor, for the services of
            residents and their guests: a cafe and a grocery store, a pharmacy,
            dry cleaning, a beauty salon and a medical center.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the northern part of the house, for small residents, there is a
            well-equipped playground for entertainment. An open eco-terrace in
            the eastern part of the house, quiet and protected from city noise,
            for those who prefer to drink a cup of coffee at dawn in the summer
            under the first rays of the sun, or those who decide to soak up the
            sun by noon.
